The goal here is to see whether augmenting the training data using generative models can improve classifcation accuracy for the test images. 

The code to pre-process the CIFAR-10 data-set (unpickle and load) has been forked from https://github.com/wolfib/image-classification-CIFAR10-tf

The base architecture for the classifier is based on the CIFAR-10 classifier present in the TensorFlow tutorials, just more amenable to change. For the original code (much more polished), please refer : https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/cifar10
